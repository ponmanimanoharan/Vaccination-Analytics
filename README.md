# Vaccination-Analytics
Vaccination Analytics is a personal data project designed to mirror real-world analytics in global health. It uses live public health API data to analyze vaccination trends across countries, processes the data using Python, stores it in a PostgreSQL database, and visualizes the results using Tableau.
# Extract Data from WHO GHO OData API
This Project begins by pulling real-time data from the WHO Global Health Observatory (GHO) OData API. Using Python, the API response is fetched in JSON format and parsed into a clean dataframe using pandas. The dataset includes vaccination relades information by country and year.
